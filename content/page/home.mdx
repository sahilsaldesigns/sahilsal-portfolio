# Sahil Sal

Hi â€” I'm Sahil Sal, a product designer and front-end developer building human-centered digital products. I focus on clear interactions, accessible interfaces, and pragmatic engineering.

I work across product design, prototyping, and front-end development (React / Next.js). Below are links to a few selected case studies.
