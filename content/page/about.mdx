      Is a UI designer based in Mumbai, India, currently designing at Media.net.
      His journey into the world of design is deeply personal and inspiring.


      Initially, he aspired to become an automobile photographer, capturing the
      essence of motion through his lens. However, his career took a fascinating
      turn, influenced by his family's creative legacy. His uncle, **Shailendra
      Salekar**, and elder brother, **Akshay Salekar**, both accomplished
      designers and his mentors, introduced him to the dynamic field of design.


      What started as curiosity turned into a passion. Today, driven by a hunger
      to craft designs, his journey stands as an evidence to embracing change
      and discovering one's true calling, with an eagerness to explore where
      this path will lead next.
