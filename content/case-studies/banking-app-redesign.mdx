## Project Overview

FinanceFlow Co. approached us to redesign their aging mobile banking application. The existing app had poor user engagement metrics and accessibility issues that were limiting their user base.

## Challenge

The primary challenges were:
- **Low user adoption**: The previous design felt outdated and was difficult to navigate
- **Accessibility gaps**: WCAG compliance issues prevented many users from using the app
- **Performance issues**: Slow transaction processing and confusing workflows

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive redesign focused on:

### 1. User Research
Conducted extensive user interviews with over 50 banking app users to understand pain points and expectations.

### 2. Design System
Created a scalable design system with:
- Clear typography hierarchy
- Accessible color palette with proper contrast ratios
- Reusable components for consistency

### 3. Key Features
- **Simplified Dashboard**: Quick access to accounts, transfers, and recent transactions
- **One-tap Transfers**: Streamlined money transfer workflow
- **Bill Payment**: Intuitive bill scheduling and payment tracking
- **Account Management**: Easy account settings and security controls

### 4. Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
- Screen reader optimization
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast mode support

## Results

Post-launch metrics showed significant improvements:
- **35% increase** in daily active users
- **42% reduction** in support tickets
- **4.8/5** app store rating (up from 3.2)
- **98%** accessibility compliance score

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React Native with TypeScript
- **Design Tools**: Figma for design and prototyping
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

## Key Learnings

Working on this project taught us the importance of accessibility-first design and the business impact it can have. By prioritizing user needs and accessibility standards from the beginning, we created a product that served a wider audience and generated better business outcomes.
