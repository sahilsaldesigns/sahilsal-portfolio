      This personal project began with a curiosity about how people navigate
      uncertainty in high-pressure, real-world environments—and how better
      information can change that experience.


      Walking into a popular brewpub on a friday night usually comes with a
      familiar question:

      “How long is the wait?”


      At Doolally Taproom, one of India’s most loved brewpubs, this question is
      asked repeatedly—by walk-in guests trying to decide whether to stay, and
      by staff trying to manage expectations during peak hours.


      This case study explores how I approached designing a walk-in wait-time
      visibility system that helps guests make informed decisions while reducing
      manual coordination for staff.

      Direct walk-in customers face frustrations without unclear information on
      seating availability or wait times, they often experience uncertainty and
      extended delays, sometimes leading to abandoned visits.

    title: The Solution
    content: >
      To address this challenge, I designed a walk-in wait-time visibility
      system that provides guests with real-time information before and after
      arriving at the venue.


      The solution focuses on expectation management, not operational
      optimization. It complements existing reservation systems rather than
      replacing them.
